Title: Statistical and Probabilistic Algorithm for Classification and Clustering

Description: This package provides a penalized approach to estimate the number of
    principal components from either a list of sample eigenvalues or a data matrix
    on which the sample eigenvalues can be derived in the context of Probabilistic
    Principal Components Analysis (PPCA). The package also provides various functions
     to simulate either the sample eigenvalue or the data matrix under specific
     structures and possibly with violation to normality or independence assumption.
     The number of PCs uncovered can be then used as inputs in subsequent analysis
     such as clustering or classification.
