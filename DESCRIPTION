Title: Statistical and Probabilistic Algorithm for Classification and Clustering

Description: This package provides a statistical algorithm that implements a
   penalized profile log-likelihood criterion to estimate the number of effective
   dimensions of a data matrix. The data structure is modeled similarly as in
   Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA). The package also provides
   various functions to simulate either the sample eigenvalue or the data matrix
   under specific covariance structures and possibly with violation to normality
   or independence assumption. The effective dimension or the number of principal
   components uncovered using our approach can be then used as inputs in subsequent
   analysis such as clustering or classification.
